# Optical-NN
A jupyter notebook is provided to generate the theoretical simulation accuracy of the proposed single-layer Fourier-domain convolution network. Pytorch is required to run this notebook and generate the training result. The hardware simulation model is used during the training to model the optical hardware, and the weights are quantized to 0/1 in the forward pass.
